To run the server:

Rename the server/config/server-template.json file to server.json

From the server directory, run  'npm install'

To run the client:

Rename the client/config/client-template.json file to client.json

From the client directory, run 'npm install'.  Navigate to localhost:8080.

There's hot reloading set up for the client so you shouldn't have to restart either when you make changes.
