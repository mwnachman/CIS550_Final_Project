# MCIT CIS 550  2021 Final Project
Spring 2021

Week 4 Project Deliverables (Coursera):

For Milestone 5, you'll also need to finalize your GitHub repository containing all your code. In addition to the actual application, this includes any code you wrote to scrape your datasets from the web, pre-process your data and ingest into into database. The repository should also contain a list of package dependencies, and build instructions for your application so your project mentor can recreate it on her machine if necessary.
