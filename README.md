# MCIT CIS 550 Final Project
Spring 2021

*Week 4 Project Deliverables (Coursera):* For Milestone 5, you'll also need to finalize your GitHub repository containing all your code. In addition to the actual application, this includes any code you wrote to scrape your datasets from the web, pre-process your data and ingest into into database. The repository should also contain a list of package dependencies, and build instructions for your application so your project mentor can recreate it on her machine if necessary.



To run:

Get a setlistFM API key and fill in the blank located in /config/server.json.

From the root directory, run 'npm install'.  In separate shell tabs, run 'npm run watch' to start the Express server and 'npm start' to run the local development server.  Navigate to localhost:8080.

There's hot reloading set up for both the client and server, so you shouldn't have to restart either when you make changes.
